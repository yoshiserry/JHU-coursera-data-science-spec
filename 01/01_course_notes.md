## Week 1 (2 Hours)
* Course overview and learning materials available.
* An overview of data science in general and each of the nine modules in the course.

* Using and installing R and R-studio.
* **Prior Knowledge:**
0. Considerable time spent prior to this investigating pathways for learning data science. - Explore the options. Pick something and go for it!
1. Familiarity with OSX; installation and setup of; general usage; configuration of programming environments OSX.
2. Installation and use of Homebrew/Cask (OSX package manager) to install R and R-studio.
3. Familiarity with the Command Line; zsh (Shell alternative), oh-my-zsh (ZSH framework), iterm2 (terminal replacement for OSX)

* **Required Files:**
  0. **ZSH Issues:** I ran into the [following issues]() when using ZSH to run some commands. [Here is the OSX setup script I use.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoshiserry/MAX/master/appinstall.sh)

The best way is source ~/.bash_profile at the end of your .zshrc file. Nothing bad will happen. Copying all the content of .bash_profile is not smart, because you have to maintain two file in synch in case you want remove zsh in the future.

  1. **[R_install.sh](https://github.com/yoshiserry/JHU-coursera-data-science-spec/blob/master/R_install.sh)** - To install R & R-Studio execute the following terminal command:
```
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yoshiserry/JHU-coursera-data-science-spec/master/01/R_install.sh)";
```
## Week 3 (3 Hours)
* **Types of Data Analysis:**
  - Descriptive - A description of what is happening in the data without trying to infer things for the next person or data point.
  - Exploratory - Find relationships and connections you didn't know about. Should not be used alone for generalising or Predicting. Correlation does not imply causation. You've discovered a relationship that is the critical relationship between two variables based on exploratory analysis alone.
  - Inferencial - Analyse a subset of data and try to infer what's happening in the brodaer dataset/population.
  - Predictive - Use data on some objects to predict the data on other object. If 'X' predicts 'Y' it does not mean 'X' causes 'Y'. More data and a simple model work best. E.g. Election or Retail purchases.
  - Causal - To find out what happens to one variable when you change another variable.
  - Mechanistic - To understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changed in other variables. (Engineering and Physics applications).
* **Data Quotes:** (Order of importance: A question, then Data)
    - 'Data' A set of items: Quantitative and Qualitative variables (measurements or characteristics).
    - Big or small you need the 'right data'.
* **Data Sharing:** [How to share data with a statistician](https://github.com/jtleek/datasharing), [share scientific data - figshare](https://figshare.com/)
* **Experimental Design**
    - [Experimental Design lecture](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-scientists-tools/lecture/NUYrv/experimental-design) What are the other variables that might be causing the relationship. **Missing: Age**, Shoe Size and Literacy. Correlation is not causation. **Data Dredging:** Keep going in your experiment until you find green jellybeans cause acne.
